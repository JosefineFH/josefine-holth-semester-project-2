## General Info
<!-- When starting the prosject it takes sometime before the heruku API replays -->
#### Level 1
<!-- This is a school assignment. I had to use a Strapi API where a login was already set up to make a GET query to retrieve a list of resources. The list must have at least 3 properties to display.
Each item must have a button or icon to switch the item in and out of localStorage. There should also be a text input to create a filter of the array.

On the favorite page, fetch the array from localStorage and display a message if localStorage is empty. It should also be possible to empty the favorite array. -->

#### Level 2
<!-- Create a login option that allows an admin user to do the following tasks
- Add things to the API. 
- Update the api.
- Delete things in the api. -->
